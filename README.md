# Basics-of-C-language-practice

Welcome to the Basics of C Program Practice repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and practice fundamental concepts of the C programming language through a series of exercises and example programs.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of basic C programs intended for beginners. Each program focuses on a specific aspect of C programming, from simple "Hello World" examples to more complex topics like pointers and file I/O.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the C programs in this repository, you will need a C compiler. We recommend using `gcc`, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection.

## Exercises
  Provided with Code in this repository

### Hello World

The classic first program in any language. This exercise introduces the basic structure of a C program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
